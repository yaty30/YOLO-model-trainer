# Ultralytics Tiger-pose Dataset

## Introduction

[Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com) Tiger-pose is a specialized dataset aimed at the pose estimation of tigers. It consists of 210 trai[README.md](README.md)ning and 53 validation images, each annotated with 12 keypoints per tiger. Due to the dataset's narrow focus, it serves as an excellent resource for refining pose estimation models, particularly those that need to handle non-human subjects.

This dataset is intended for use with Ultralytics [HUB](https://hub.ultralytics.com) and [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).

## Key Points Structure

The dataset contains 12 keypoints per tiger, focused on various anatomical landmarks. It should be noted that this dataset does not include a third dimension for keypoint visibility.

## Sample Images and Annotations

Here are some examples of images from the dataset, along with their corresponding annotations in a training mosaic:
